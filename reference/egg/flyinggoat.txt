Two guys are out hiking in the wilderness when they come across this really
big, deep hole in the ground. This hole is pitch black. They cannot see the
bottom at all.
So one guy picks up a pebble and tosses it in, and they listen ... nothing. Wow
this thing is deep.
The other guy then picks up a football sized boulder and heaves that in, and
they listen ... nothing. Wow! This thing is super deep!
So the first guys says, "Hey, help me with this," and they pick up this
railroad tie in the grass and heave that in. And they listen ... Just then this
goat comes flying out of the forrest, running as fast as its legs will carry it
and runs right up and jumps in the hole.
At this point the guys are staring at each other wide eyed. What is going on
with this hole? There's no bottom. Goats are jumping in it. Is it some sort of
evil interdimentional portal?
And they're still staring wide eyed ater a while when this farm comes up and
asks, "Hey, have you guys seen my goat around here?" The guys nod vigorously
and tell the farmer the whole story about the goat running up and jumping
in the hole.  
At this pont the farmer says, "Nah. That can't be my goat. My goat is chained
to a railroad tie."
